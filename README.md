# ZNF343-analysis-workflow in R
Iterative motif analysis of ZNF343 ChIP-exo data

This code and data repository serves as supplemental info for our preprint paper "Why Do Long Zinc Finger Proteins have Short Motifs" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637298v1) and we intend to use this workflow to demo the feasibility and necessity to use iterative analysis protocol to extract longer motif information of tandem zinc finger proteins. It contains all codes and major results related to ZNF343 ChIP-exo motif analysis, including the data analysis workbook in .Rmd, .html and pdf formats respectively. You can preview our analysis workflow through link (https://zeropin.github.io/Iterative-motif-analysis-of-ZNF343.html) and (https://zeropin.github.io/Correlation-analysis-of-ZNF343-s-extended-motifs.html). The code was previously writeen in python, and now rewriten in R. Many utilities functions are called from R package TFCookbook (https://github.com/zeropin/TFCookbook). The original ChIP-exo data were downloaded from NCBI GEO database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2466539), but were not included in this repository.
