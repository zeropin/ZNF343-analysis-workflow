# ZNF343-analysis-workflow
Iterative motif analysis of ZNF343 ChIP-exo data

This code repository serves as supplemental info for our preprint paper "Why Do Long Zinc Finger Proteins have Short Motifs" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637298v1) and we intend to use this workflow to demo the feasibility to extract longer motif information for tandem zinc finger proteins by iterative analysis protocol. It contains all codes and major results related to ZNF343 ChIP-exo motif analysis, including BordersDetector code, the data analysis workbook in .ipynb, .html and pdf formats respectively, processed data, and energy motif logos for ZNF343. You can preview our analysis workflow through link (https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zeropin/ZNF343-analysis-workflow/blob/master/ZNF343%20workbook.html).The original ChIP-exo data were downloaded from NCBI GEO database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2466539), but were not included in this repository.
