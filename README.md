# ZNF343-analysis-workflow
Iterative motif analysis of ZNF343 ChIP-exo data

This code repository serves as supplemental info for our preprint paper "Why Do Long Zinc Finger Proteins have Short Motifs" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637298v1) and contains all codes used to analyze the ZNF343 ChIP-exo data, including BordersDetector.py and the major .ipnyb workbook. The original ChIP-exo data were downloaded from NCBI GEO database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2466539), but were not included in this repository. The processed data and energy motif logos are included in the repository. We intend to use this workflow to demo the feasibility to extract longer motif information for tandem zinc finger proteins by similar iterative analysis protocol
